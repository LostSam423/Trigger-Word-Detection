# Trigger Word Detection

This is an online course project done under the Deep Learning Specialization by Coursera.

Aim - To detect a certain specified trigger word, here it being `Activate`, while listening to the surroundings and start processing the words that follow it.
This project has scope to be further extended to integrate with a computer that would do a certain specified task on trigger.

Brief Implementation- 
- Pre-processed raw foreground and background noise data into spectograms using  Fourier Transform
- Trained a GRU, convolutional and dense layer based unidirectional Recurrent Neural Network
